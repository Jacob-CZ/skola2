# Car rental project

## Features
 - postgress storage
 - storage bucket for car photo storage
 - runs on wasm
 - deployed on gh-pages
 - dynamic routes for the individual entities


## why is the code not DRY
 - it was dificult to abstract the funcitons because they need acces to the global supabase client and they are often very similar but not the same

## why supabase
- it is a back end as a service so the page can be static

## Is blazor any good
- I think its rubbish ( the only good thing is that it is strongely typed )
- But maybe i just havent discovered its magic 
- Is next js better?  yes (with type script)
